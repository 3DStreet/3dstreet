3DStreet creates 3D visualizations of your 2D [Streetmix.net](https://streetmix.net) streets using A-Frame and WebXR. Developers can use the same core [`street` A-Frame component](#a-frame-street-component-api) of 3DStreet for their own projects.

### Quick Start - How to make your own 3D street:
* First, use <a href="https://streetmix.net">Streetmix.net</a> to create a street design. (Streetmix is a tool that lets you design, remix, and share your neighborhood street. <a href="https://github.com/streetmix/streetmix/blob/master/README.md#about">More information about Streetmix here</a>.)
* Then, save a Streetmix street after making an account to generate a unique URL for your street looking something like this: `https://streetmix.net/kfarr/3/my-awesome-street-name`
* Load https://github.3d.st/, paste in your street URL, and press enter or the refresh button.
* See your Streetmix street in 3D! See instant changes to your work: Switch back to a Streetmix.net tab, make changes to your street, then reload the 3DStreet page to see the edits applied.

## A-Frame component
3DStreet is built upon a custom A-Frame `street` component which is also available for you to customize for your own custom A-Frame street scenes. The `street` component takes a string of JSON and renders one or more "segments" (also known as lanes or slices) of a street and optionally buildings and ground to the left and right.
### Usage Example

### A-Frame `street` Component API

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| JSON | A string of JSON containing an array one or more segments (also known as slices) representing cross-section parts of a street. See [basic-json.html](/examples/basic-json.html) for an example of proper usage | '' |
| type | A string representing the formatting of the JSON passed in the `JSON` property |  'streetmixSegmentsFeet' |
| left | A string to determine which [building variant](#list-of-streetmix-building-variants) to create for the left side of the street (heading outbound) | '' |
| right | A string to determine which building variant to create for the right side of the street (heading outbound). | '' |
| showGround | A boolean to determine if the ground associated with theÂ specified building variant(s) in `left` and `right` should be created or not. | true |
| showStriping | A boolean to determine if the lane stripings should be created or not. | true |

#### Orientation and Scale
A default Streetmix.net cross-section view is oriented to show vehicles heading away from you as "outbound". The `street` component follows this convention and when placed in a new A-Frame scene the default camera is looking toward the outbound direction of the generated street. The default rendering is 1:1 scale.

### A-Frame `streetmix-loader` Component API

The `streetmix-loader` component requests a Streetmix API response when given a unique street URL and then passes the segments array JSON as a string to the `street` component (which is a dependency -- you must have the `street` component on the same entity as that of the `streetmix-loader` component). 

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| streetmixStreetURL | A string representing a "user facing" Streetmix street URL such as https://streetmix.net/kfarr/3/ | '' |
| streetmixAPIURL | A string representing the Streetmix API street URL such as https://streetmix.net/api/v1/streets/7a633310-e598-11e6-80db-ebe3de713876 | '' |

Either 1 of the 2 properties are required. If both are provided the component will use streetmixAPIURL value and ignore streetmixStreetURL.

### List of Supported Segment Types

3DStreet does not yet support all of the street `segments` found in Streetmix. You may find some segments don't display at all or are missing 3D elements. Here is a complete list:

| [Streetmix Segment Type](https://github.com/streetmix/streetmix/blob/master/assets/scripts/segments/info.json)              | 3DStreet Support? | Variants  | Notes and Model Source |
