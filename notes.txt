Some notes on dimensions

Each segment "type" is a separate model. The models are created using MagicaVoxel. Normally a MagicaVoxel voxel = 1 meter in A-Frame by default, however for this project each voxel represents 1 decimeter (1/10th of a meter). The app reduces the size of the model (scale * 0.1) to compensate.

Default model widths:
* bike-lane 1.8m (18 voxel units)
* drive-lane 3m (30 voxel units)
* divider 0.3m (3 voxel units) (double yellow lines)
* parking-lane 2.4m (24 voxel units)
