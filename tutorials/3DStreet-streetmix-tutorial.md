# 3DStreet and Streetmix Tutorial

## Introduction

3DStreet and Streetmix have a truly symbiotic relationship. When combined, you can use these platforms to create compelling and accurate 3D visualizations of streets in a matter of seconds. This tutorial will show you how to get started!

The tutorial is broken up into three sections:
- **Building Your Street Using Streetmix** teaches you the basics of how to use Streetmix.
- **Viewing Your Streetmix Street in 3D Using 3DStreet** showcases how simple it is to import your Streetmix street into 3DStreet.
- **Final Thoughts** discusses the relationship between 3DStreet and Streetmix at a high level.

## Building Your Street Using Streetmix

Streetmix is an interactive web app that makes street design intuitive and user-friendly. To get started, open up a web browser and navigate to [https://streetmix.net/](https://streetmix.net/). You should see a 2D visualization of a city street. There are a few simple ways to make this scene your own. In the bottom part of your screen, there are various entities available to add to your street.

As we can see above, Streetmix includes a Wayfinding Sign. Let's start by adding this to our scene. To do this, we can simply drag and drop the segment into our street.

Streetmix also allows you to edit segments that have already been added to your street. Each segment has various properties that can be edited to meet the needs of your street. To edit a segment, simply use the widget that appears when you hover your mouse above a given segment. The image on the right showcases how to change the orientation of cars in the parking lane. On the left, we demonstrate how to remove segments.

Keep experimenting with your Streetmix street until you find a street layout that you love. Then, proceed to the next section of this tutorial!

## Viewing your Streetmix street in 3D using 3DStreet

At 3dstreet, we have worked hard to streamline the process of importing your Streetmix street into 3DStreet. To get started, select the share drop-down menu in your Streetmix window and copy the sharing link.

Next, navigate to [https://github.3d.st/#https://streetmix.net/kfarr/3](https://github.3d.st/#https://streetmix.net/kfarr/3) or your locally hosted instance of 3DStreet. Enter your URL into the search bar and refresh the scene or press enter.

Alternatively, you can add `3d` to the end of your streetmix.net domain name to view your street using 3DStreet. For instance, the Streetmix URL `https://streetmix.net/kfarr/65/temp-barricade` can be changed to `https://streetmix3d.net/kfarr/65/temp-barricade` to view your street in 3D.

Enjoy your Streetmix street in 3D! Feel free to share your street with friends and family. If you would like to make instant changes to your work, simply edit your street in Streetmix. Then, you can reload your 3DStreet page to see your edits applied.
