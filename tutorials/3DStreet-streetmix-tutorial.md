# 3DStreet and Streetmix Tutorial

## Introduction

3DStreet and Stretmix have a truly symbiotic relationship. When combined, you can use these platforms to create compelling and accurate 3D visualizations of streets in a matter of seconds. This tutorial will show you how to get started!

The tutorial is broken up into three sections:
- Building your street using streetmix
- Viewing your streetmix street in 3D using 3dstreet
- Final Thoughts

## Building your street using streetmix

Streetmix is an interactive web app that makes street design intuitive and user-friendly. To get started, open up a web-browser and navigate to [https://streetmix.net/](https://streetmix.net/). You should see a 2D visualization of a city street. There are a few simple ways to make this scene your own. In the bottom part of your screen there are various entities available to add to your street.

As we can see above, streetmix includes a Wayfinding Sign. Let's start by adding this to our scene. To do this, we can simply drag and drop the entity into our street.

Streetmix also allows you to edit assets that have already been added to your street. For instance, you can remove entities by hovering over a segment and selecting remove. You can also edits various properties of entities by using the controls in the widget. On the right, we showcase how to change the direction that the cars in the parking lane are facing.

Keep experimenting with your streetmix street until you find a street layout that you love. Then, proceed to the next step!

## Viewing your streetmix street in 3D using 3dstreet

At 3dstreet, we have worked hard to streamline the process of importing your streetmix street into 3dstreet. To get started, select the share dropdown menu in your streetmix window and copy the sharing link.

Next, navagate to [https://github.3d.st/#https://streetmix.net/kfarr/3](https://github.3d.st/#https://streetmix.net/kfarr/3) or your locally hosted instance of 3dstreet. Enter your url into the search bar and refresh the scene or press enter.

Enjoy your streetmix street in 3D! Feel free to share your street with freinds and family. If you would like to make instant changes to your work, simply edit your street in streetmix. Then, you can reload your 3dstreet page to see your edits applied. 

## Final Thoughts

Notes for PR: 

Since the current iteration of our technology revolves around our users ability to create street layouts in streetmix and import them into 3DStreet, it is important that we have a clear tutorial for how to navigate this inherently unintuitive process.
